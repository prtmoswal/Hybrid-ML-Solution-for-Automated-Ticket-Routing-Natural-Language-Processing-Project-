# Hybrid-ML-Solution-for-Automated-Ticket-Routing-Natural-Language-Processing-Project-


Engineered a comprehensive NLP project to streamline customer support operations. The system employs a two-stage machine learning pipeline:

Unsupervised Topic Discovery (NMF): Used Non-negative Matrix Factorization to identify and label key complaint themes from unstructured ticket data.

Supervised Topic Classification (XGBoost): Trained an XGBoost model on these NMF-generated labels to accurately and automatically classify new incoming tickets.

The final Streamlit application provides instant topic predictions, empowering businesses to enhance response times, optimize resource allocation, and gain deeper insights into customer pain points.
